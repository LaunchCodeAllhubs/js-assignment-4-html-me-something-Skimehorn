      <p id="funParagraph">My name is Jared and this is my top 5 favorite games/series!
         Ive been playing video games most of my life and started playing board games as well in 2018.
         This is a list of video and board games I think are worth giving a try.

      <h2>The Legend of Zelda</h2>
      <a href="https://zelda.com/"><img src="./images/ZeldaPic.jpeg" alt="Zelda"></a>

      <p>Ill start by saying all games in the series are worth playing and are favorites among millions. However, my
         favorites would be the 2 most recent,
         Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom. Both are open world games that give the series a fresh approach to
         the rpg style and really allow you
         the freedom of exploration. If you want to lose yourself for a month or two these are the games for you.</p>
